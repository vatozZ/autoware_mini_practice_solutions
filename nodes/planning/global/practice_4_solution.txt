Solution to the last task

The array of waypoints obtained after the waypoint calculation is sent to the align_goal_point() function.

The Euclidean distance between each waypoint and the start point (current location) is calculated. 
The point with the minimum Euclidean distance is found to determine the start_index.

The Euclidean distance between each waypoint and the goal point is calculated. 
The point with the minimum Euclidean distance is found to determine the end_index.

The waypoints list is then clipped to include only the elements from the start_index up to and including the end_index.

The last waypoint's coordinates are then set to the exact coordinates of the matched goal point.
