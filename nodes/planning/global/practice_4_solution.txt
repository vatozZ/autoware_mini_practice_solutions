Solution to the last task

- The array of waypoints obtained after the waypoint calculation is sent to the align_goal_point() function.
- Here, the Euclidean distance between each waypoint and the goal point is calculated. 
- The point with the minimum Euclidean distance is actually the closest point to the goal. 
- For the elements within the waypoints list, the part of the list up to the point closest to the goal_point is retained, and the section after that relevant point is removed.
